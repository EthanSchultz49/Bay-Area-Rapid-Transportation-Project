# Bay Area Rapid Transportation (BART) Ridership Prediction Project

In this project, we analyzed BART ridership levels by collecting data from various sources. We identified several predictor variables that might affect ridership patterns, including weather, gas prices, station traffic, and violation categories.

## Data Collection & Preparation
The data was gathered from various websites, including public transit, weather, and economic sources. We collected multiple datasets containing information on factors such as:
- **BART Ridership Levels**: Monthly passenger counts for various stations
- **Weather Data**: Monthly weather conditions for each station
- **Gas Prices**: Local gas prices for the BART area
- **Covid Impacts**: Binary Variable 1 for COVID times and 0 for before

The datasets were initially in different formats and needed significant preprocessing. We used Excel to manipulate and clean the data, ensuring everything was properly formatted and combined into a single, tidy dataset. This allowed for efficient analysis and modeling.

## Modeling & Analysis
Once the data was prepared, we applied various modeling techniques to predict BART ridership levels and identify the key predictors that had the most significant impact. The goal was to provide actionable insights for BART to:
- **Reduce costs**
- **Enhance rider experience**
- **Support sustainability initiatives**

## Key Findings & Recommendations
Through our analysis, we aimed to uncover the most influential factors that could help BART optimize operations, improve service, and encourage higher ridership while minimizing environmental impact.
